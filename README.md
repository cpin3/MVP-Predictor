# MVP-Predictor
a Data/Machine learning project predicting the next NBA MVP for the 2022-23 season.

The Process involved Webscraping data from Basketballreference.com using Pandas and BeautifulSoup.

After webscraping data, we had to combine all the relevant parameters into one useable set of fields. 

Once the fields were combined the model was able to make a prediction regarding who the 2023 MVP will be.
